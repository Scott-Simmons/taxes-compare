Available on: https://taxes-compare.com/

Details on the solution [here](/server/methodology.md).

### App Components

- [Frontend](/client/README.md)
- [Backend](/server/README.md)
- [Infrastructure](/deploy/README.md)

Note: data for each countries tax schedules are [in the backend as a config file](https://github.com/Scott-Simmons/taxes-compare/blob/93868822405f519328868a45673f23643f3fb76b/server/assets/taxes.json). This data will eventually go stale if this repo is not maintained.

Contributions for updating tax schedules, adding new countries, and/or adding new currencies are welcome.
